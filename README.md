Jester
======

Jester is a portmanteau of Joel's Tester. This is a simple unit testing framework that I am working on. 
It is not intended to fill any sort of niche. It only intend to use it for myself. 

Most likely this will be of no use to anybody except myself.
I created it because I got tired having to reinstall NUnit everytime I downloaded one of my projects to a different computer.
